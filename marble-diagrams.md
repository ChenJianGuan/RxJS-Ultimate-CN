#Marble Diagrams
A marble diagram is a graphical representation of applying one or more operators to x number of streams. It can look like this :

```
---v-----v---->
-------v------>
operator
---r---r------>
```

The whole point is to make it easier to understand what the operator does.
Most operators in Rxjs is covered at [Rx Marbles](http://rxmarbles.com/)
