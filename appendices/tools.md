# Tools

The idea with this section is to list nice tools that helps you when writing RxJS code

## RxJS DevTools

Found on github link [https://github.com/kwintenp/rx-devtools](https://github.com/kwintenp/rx-devtools) The README lists how to install the the npm/ yarn module and also the chrome plugin.

Very nice tool for visualising what your code does and what values will be emitted.

## RxFiddle

Just go to the page [http://rxfiddle.net/\#type=editor](http://rxfiddle.net/#type=editor) and start writing your RxJS expressions. It will show you a visual of what a run looks like. It doesn't get any simpler.
