# Rxjs 5 ultimate

This book is meant to be starter as well as intermediate book for anyone starting out with Rxjs.

Tweet me @chris\_noring for questions, cheers, comments. See you out there

The different articles can be read in any order but it is recommended when you are new to Rxjs to look at the basics like [Observable](/observable-anatomy.md) [Observer](/observer.md) and [Producer](/producer.md)

This is a work in progress so chapters are likely to be added and changed, less and less so as time passes, but the work was started on this on the 21 feb 2017..

If you like using Rxjs /Rxjs 5 be sure to tweet @BenLesh or @mattpodwysocki etc and say thank you, or good job. It means a lot..

I have now synced this book with a GitHub repo. If you wish to contribute or correct something, please raise a PR at https://github.com/softchris/Rxjs5-Ultimate
